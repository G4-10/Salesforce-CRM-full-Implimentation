# Salesforce CRM Full Implementation Project

**Project:** Salesforce CRM Implementation  
**Client:** KIPCCUL (Kimbo Police Cooperative Credit Union)  
**Country:** Cameroon  
**Date:** 11 January 2021

This was a project for my client KIPCCUL, where they wanted to implement Salesforce CRM in their organization, migrating from a legacy CRM. They were very concerned about the security of their organization's data during the move to Salesforce.

I served as both the Salesforce Administrator and Salesforce Consultant, providing them with:

- Benefits of Salesforce  
- Implementation procedure  
- Gap identification and solutioning  
- Strategy for full adoption  
- Data security measures  

The implementation process was broken down into **eight phases** and the project was completed successfully.
