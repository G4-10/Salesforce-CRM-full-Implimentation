This was a project for my client **KIPCCUL**, where they wanted to implement Salesforce CRM in their organization, migrating from a **legacy CRM**. They were very concerned about the **security of their organization's data** during the move to Salesforce.

I served as both the **Salesforce Administrator** and **Salesforce Consultant**, providing them with:

- The benefits of using Salesforce  
- A clear outline of the implementation procedure  
- Identification of system and process gaps  
- Suggested solutions for every gap identified  
- Strategies for full adoption by the organization  
- Most importantly, ensuring the **security of their data**

I broke down the implementation process into **eight (8) key phases**, and the project was completed successfully.
